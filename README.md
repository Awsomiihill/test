## a shitty bash file that doubles your animes framerate (linux)

### *warning: you need to install rife-ncnn-vulkan first (and, well, ffmpeg I guess), you dumb nut*

yes this is a shitty bash file I made because I got tired of running the same commands over and over again 
until my fingers fell off and my prefrontal coretex was but a pile of gooey mash

introducing: hello.bash! the best worst bash file in existance!

this is a test btw
